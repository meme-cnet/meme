Kennedy is a universally known event that requires no explanation, unlike a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT that might necessitate research to understand its value."

In the case of the Moon landing, the cameraman reflected in the astronaut's helmet signals the \"possibility\" that the whole thing was staged, hence it's a reference to the conspiracy theories that surround the moon landing."
